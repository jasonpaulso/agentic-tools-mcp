# Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The MCP server code has been successfully refactored to improve maintainability, reduce code duplication, and create a more modular architecture.

## Key Changes

### 1. Tool Registry System
- Created `src/tools/registry.ts` - A centralized tool management system
- Created `src/tools/base-tool.ts` - Base interfaces and error handling for all tools
- Standardized tool creation with the `createTool` helper function

### 2. Modular Tool Organization
Tools are now organized by feature area:

#### Task Management (`src/tools/task-management/`)
- `projects.ts` - Project management tools
- `tasks.ts` - Task management tools  
- `subtasks.ts` - Subtask management tools
- `advanced.ts` - Advanced features (PRD parsing, recommendations, analysis, research)
- `index.ts` - Exports all task management tools

#### Agent Memories (`src/tools/agent-memories/`)
- `memories.ts` - All memory management tools
- `index.ts` - Exports all memory tools

### 3. Simplified Server
The `streamable-server.ts` file has been dramatically simplified:
- **Before**: 1,796 lines with all tool definitions inline
- **After**: 133 lines using the tool registry system
- 93% reduction in file size!

### 4. Benefits
- **Maintainability**: Tools are now organized in logical groups
- **Extensibility**: Adding new tools is as simple as creating a new file and adding to the appropriate index
- **Reusability**: Common error handling and patterns are centralized
- **Testability**: Individual tools can be tested in isolation
- **Clarity**: The server file now focuses solely on HTTP transport logic

## No Functional Changes
All existing functionality has been preserved - this was a pure refactoring exercise focused on code organization and maintainability.
